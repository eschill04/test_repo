About,I am an abstract artist. I focus on the interplay of shapes, patterns, and colors. My work aims to create visual impact through the use of simple, yet eye-catching structures.

Over the past four years, I’ve experimented with corrugated cardboard and wood—cutting, painting, and even turning some pieces into stop-motion videos to explore movement and storytelling.​

These days, I'm drawing with pencil and colored pencil, as well as painting with acrylic on canvas and wood panels. Each medium allows me to delve deeper into my study of composition, and the dynamic relationships between form and color.
Studio,My studio is located in the attic of my New Jersey home. It's a peaceful place that overlooks trees, farmland, and distant hills.
